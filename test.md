## Word Scramble Game

## *Individual Designs*

### Design 1

![Isaac Silva's Design](designs/design_Isaac_Silva.png)

The UML design shown above was created by Isaac Silva. One of the main highlights for this design is that it is very clean and very well organized. The design has excellent portrayal of the overall system to be implemented which made it very easy to visualize the overall design of the system. The design avoids extra cluttering by including most of the design requirements within four modules and also incorporates all the functional requirements needed by the system. Class components described in the UML are consistent i.e all components accurately display class specific attributes and functions. Design also uses a combination of getter and setter methods encompassing good programming practice. Interaction between the components are showcased explicitly by providing concise explanation of each connection.

As an entry point to the application, the designer uses a 'User' class by including most of the essential design requirements such as creating a new player, viewing player statistics, maintaining game progress, solved game list, etc. Similarly, the 'Game' class, quite aptly, handles everything pertaining to the word scramble game as well as the statistics. The external web service utility also appropriately addresses the design requirements.

While the design covers everything that is required, it does not include any underlying database, which according to the designer, seems to be unnecessary for the model. Although, the design in less cluttered with minimal modules, however, to make the design easier to implement a few additional modules addressing specific tasks such as dedicated module to statistics, creating a new player, etc would have been more appropriate from implementation point of view. Never the less, the design makes a lot of sense overall and is used as the basis for the final team design. 


### Design 2

![Mukul Pai's Design](designs/design_Mukul_Pai.png)

The design presented above was created by Mukul Pai. Including a 'Statistics' class to encapsulate the logic of how to get statistics is one the main postives of this design. This design also expresses cardinality quite appropriately between the 'User' and the 'Player' and then between the 'Player' and the 'Scramble' classes. Another highlight of the design is that object oriented approach is clearly defined between the 'Scramble' class and associated classes 'NewScramble', 'ProgressScramble', etc & then between the 'Statistics' class and 'PlayerStatistics' and 'ScrambleStatistics' classes.

Similar to the rest of the team members, the design uses a 'User' class as an entry point to the application handling all the information that is required to create a new player. Along with that, the Scramble class and its associated classes clearly separated, addressing all what was required as part of the design requirements, however, the return data types for few of the methods were not that explicit, specifically the statistics object returned by few methods do not mentioned the returned data types.

The design having more detailed UML design can be very apt in some cases, however, a more simpler design could have been more appropriate as some of the additional classes could have been engulfed into the parent classes such as the 'Loggedin' feature and scramble (in-progress, completed). Another feaure not present in the diagram was an underlying database to handle player, scramble and statistical information.


### Design 3 

![Saad Khan's Design](designs/design_Saad_Khan.png)

This design was generated by Saad Khan. From the user point of view, this application design excellently covers all the different components that are to be involved in the application with accurate interactions and flow. Good design principles were followed to showcase attributes of each component along with their functionalities. This design also had similarities with another team member's design in terms of the appraoch taken to include statistics class (playerStatistics, scrambleStatistics) and also having multiple instances of the word scramble.

In comparison to rest of the individual member design, the application design begins a user class, where the user has a choice of either choosing to login if his/her user profile is already in the system otherwise just choose to enter as new player in order to land onto a new player profile creation page/activity. This way the design for the UI point of view seems less cluttered, however, a more simpler approch could have been to encompass it as an instance of the player class rather keeping it as a separate class. 

The design also includes an underlying database (providing connectivity between the external web service (EWS) and rest of the modules), which during team discussion was considered a feature that could have been excluded from the UML and this way the EWS, a centralized utility, could have been connected in a way to be accessed by all other components in the system. Overall nice job but there seem to be quite a few class and the design coudl have been simplified in certain cases such as 'createWordScramble' class could have been an instance of the 'wordScramble' class while 'solveWordScramble' class could aslo have been described a method for the 'wordScramble' class.



## *Team Design*

![Team Design](designs/design_team.png)

As a collective team effort, we setup multiple calls to re-visit various requirements of the design and reviewed pros and cons for each individual member's design. The disscussions were thorough which led to the final UML deisgn as shown above, which is an enhanced/updated version of the individual UML created by one of the team members, Isaac Silva (Design 1). The team was in unanimous agreement that the application's entry point should be the 'User' class also evident in all the individual UML designs as well as the final design. It was decided that the 'User' class will give three options to the user to (1) create a new user profile by accepting user credentials such as first name, last name, email, username, etc, (2) login if the profile is already in the system by askig for a unique username and an option to (3) logout from the application when required. This approach led to an agreement amongst team members on how to distinguish between new and existing players right when the application is launched.

Although, the 'User' class was present in all 3 individual designs, it had different purpose for each design. While, for Mukul's (Design 2) and Saad's (Design 3) design, the 'User' class was never directly fetching player statistics, in Isaac's individual design (Design 1) the 'User' class was providing methods to fetch player statistics, game progress, games created, etc. A lot of thought process went into keeping the 'User' class as clean/less cluttered as possible. the idea of incorporating a separate class for player statistics helped fine tune the 'User' class to only include necessary methods as described above ('createNewPlayer', 'login', 'logout'). The details of separate classes for statistics is discussed in the following paragraphs.

It was also agreed upon amongst the members that once the user is logged in as an existing player, he/she will have four options to choose from. (1) to create a word scramble, realized by the 'Game' class which will serve as a blueprint for word scramble creations. For the case (2) where a player has to choose and solve word scrambles, this is realized by 'PlayEvent' association class providing actual game instance for a user. For the other 2 options, there was a lot of discussion on how to realize the viewing statistics part (both player and scramble), once the player has logged in. Two members, Mukul (Design 2) and Saad (Design 3), had explicitly used separate scramble and player statistic classes in their individual designs which was not the case in Isaac's design (Design 1), so as a result of team discussions it was collectively agreed upon that in order to better encapsulate the functionality required by the scramble statistics and player statistics components, addition of 2 utility classes will be helpful. For this reason, 'ScrambleStatistics' and 'PlayerStatistics' utility classes are added to Isaac's design which will be responsible for retrieving all the statistics around scrambles and players. In assoication with these utility classes (once the player is logged in) for the case (3) where a player wants to be able to view statistics on their created and solved word scrambles, will be addressed by addition of a class 'ScrambleStatistic' associated with each 'Game' instance. For the case (4) where a player may view his/her own statistics, a similar class 'PlayerStatistic' is added which is associated with each 'Player' instance.

Realization of the case where the user is a new player was straight forward and it was communally decided within the team (also present in all 3 individual designs) that the user, while creating a new player profile, will pass on inputs as new user credentials onto the 'addUser' method in the external web service utility (EWS) which will then return a unique user ID for that new player which will register that player with the system. In contrast to this, for the scenario where player has an option to create a new word scramble, all 3 designs had taken different approaches, however, for the final design, this requirement was realized based primarily on Isaac's individual design by using only the 'createNewGame', 'refreshCrumbledPhrase' and 'saveGame' methods inside the 'Game' class while excluding 'getGameList', 'updateSolvedTimes' and 'getScrambleStatistics' methods which were also present in his original individual design. Similarly, most of the getter and setter methods such as 'getinProgressGameList', 'getSolvedGameList', 'setNumberOfSolvedGames' etc, which were part of the 'User' class in Isaac's individual design were also excluded from the 'User' class in the final design. All of the above mentioned methods/functionalities, in the final design, reside under inside the 'ScrambleStatistic' and the 'PlayerStatistic' classes.

Further discussion between the team members took place on how to represent statistics requirements more efficiently. Instead of creating only 2 classes, one for addressing scramble statistics (requirement 11 - assignment 5) and another one for addressing player statistics (requirement 12 - assignment 5), the idea of keeping separate utility classes (<<utility>> - ScrambleStatistics, <<utility>> - PlayerStatistics) and 'Game' & 'User' associated classes ('ScrambleStatistic', 'PlayerStatistic') was specifically incorporated into the final design for proper encapsulation by providing loose-coupling and flexibility. While almost all of the requirements in point 11 and 12 were addressed in the associated classes'PlayerStatistic' and 'ScrambleStatistic', only methods such as <<utility>> - ScrambleStatistics: ('getScrambleStatistics', 'getGameList') and <<utility>> - PlayerStatistics: ('getPlayerStatistics') were kept in the respective utility classes in order to utilize the EWS to extract the desired statistics.

It was agreed upon within the team that coming up with a class structure that is clean, concise and properly scoped is the key for properly capturing and executing requirements. Structuring the final design this way made it less cluttered and was a combination of best intuitions present in each of the team member's designs.

11 - The scramble statistics shall list all scrambles with (1) their unique identifier, (2) information on whether they were solved or created by the player, and (3) the number of times any player has solved them. This list shall be sorted by decreasing number of solutions.

In order to realize this requirement, two methods are used from the ExternalWebService utility class:

- retrievePlayersAndSolvedScrambles: ArrayList<Map<User, ArrayList< Game>>>
- getListOfWordScrambleGamesAndAuthors(): ArrayList<Map<Game, User>>

The former returns a list of all players and the scrambles each solved. The latter returns the list of all scrambles and its authors. By callind both methods, filtering the results and making the appropriate calculations, we get fulfill the requirements described in this section. For convenience, we also added a new property called "numberOfTimesSolved: Integer" in the Game class, in order to facilitate sorting of games by the number of times players solved them. A setter method called "setSolvedTimes(game: Game)" was added to the same class in order to set the numberOfTimesSolved attribute.


A method called "getScrambleStatistics()" was added to the Game clas in order to wrap the calls to the methods in the ExternalWebService utility class and perform the necessary filtering and calculations. 


12 - The player statistics will list players’ first names and last names, with (1) the number of scrambles that the player has solved, (2) the number of new scrambles created, and (3) the average number of times that the scrambles they created have been solved by other players.  It will be sorted by decreasing number of scrambles that the player has solved.

In order to realize this requirement, two methods are used from the ExternalWebService utility class:

- retrievePlayersAndSolvedScrambles: ArrayList<Map<User, ArrayList< Game>>>
- getListOfWordScrambleGamesAndAuthors(): ArrayList<Map<Game, User>>

By callind the above methods, filtering the results and performing the necessary calculations accordingly, points 1,2,3 can be easily met. In order to facilitate sorting and making the calculations more explicit, the following properties, alongside with its setters methods, were added to the User class:

- numberOfSolvedGames: Integer
- numberOfGamesCreated: Integer 
- authoredGamesSolvedAverage: Integer


A method called "getPlayerStatistics()" was added to the User class in order to wrap the calls to the methods in the ExternalWebService utility class and perform the necessary filtering and calculations. 


In addition, proper naming of properties and methods is paramount for the successful communication of requirements across all team members. 

In the process of coming up with this design, it was crucial to combine the best intuitions present in each of the team's designs. Coming up with a class structure that is clean, concise and properly scope is key for properly capturing and executing requirements. 

 However, between the Administrator and the Cryptogram was more involved and an area of discussion amongst the team. We could either make a straight call to cryptogram for both the edit and the add however, if we used this approach where would the result message and the generated unique ID reside. It could have been on either the Cryptogram class or the helper class of addCryptogram. We agreed to use the helper addCryptogram class for the addCryptogram method for the admin. What is not shown here as we did not believe it had a large impact on the design was the cryptogram validation. This we decided would occur within the administrator method addCryptogram. Though not all individual designs included the same functionality, the team design incorporated a simple “edits” association and included a separate editCryptogram operation within Administrator to signify that the administrator should be able to edit any cryptogram at any time, not just at the time they submit a new one. The association between Player and Cryptogram was commonly agreed to be “solves” with the choosing and viewing of cryptograms implied by that simple relationship.

In the scenario that a user logged in as a player to the system they will be brought to the Player class in which we all agreed should contain the values of the users first name and last name. There was some discussion on whether these values should reside on the user level but we did not believe that the administrator needed to have these values. As a player in the system, the user shall be able to: 1)View a list of Cryptograms 2) Choose a cryptogram to solve 3) Solve the cryptogram 4) View a list of player ratings. In order to handle these scenarios we have 4 methods which will do these exact requirements. viewCryptogram is a method which will request the uniqueID of the cryptogram that the user would like to solve. chooseCryptogram will display a list to the user in which the user can choose any of the cryptograms to view. solveCryptogram is where the player will begin to play the game and we will begin subroutines in order to keep track of metrics such as if the cryptogram was solved or not. This will tie into the utility class of PlayerRating that will store for each player the attributes which will be passed back to the method in the player class named listPlayerRatings. The player class will be tied to the database service in order to update this information once a player begins work on a cryptogram

The Cryptogram class will be used to store information on the cryptogram such as the encoded and decoded phrase for a cryptogram. Some team members included additional attributes such as a list of users who had correctly solved a particular cryptogram, but it was determined that such a list could be derived from the Player class and the relationship between Player and Cryptogram. There was also agreement that the Administrator class should not need any attributes but should include addPlayer and addCryptogram operations, in addition to the editCryptogram operation discussed earlier.

Once a cryptogram is added or edited, the cryptogram will communicate to the database so that any further requests to the cryptogram will be updated accordingly. Regarding the local database, all but one user’s individual diagram included a class entity to represent this component in the design. Two of the three users who included it left it as a complete “black box” while one user tried to add some details about the data structures that would be stored there. It was decided that there does not need to be a lot of detail about the database in this UML class diagram, so it was left as a simple class with no attributes or operations. A “uses” dependency was established between the DatabaseService and the User superclass as well as Cryptogram. Similarly, three team members included some kind of class structure to handle player ratings. It was decided we should have a class representing the collection of attributes belonging to a player such as totalSolved, totalStarted, and so on.

We discussed the ExternalWebService utility class and how exactly it will communicate with our system. We deemed that it should essentially be a gateway to an external server. As a result, this class will simply pass information about by using the methods sendPlayerRatings, sendCryptogram, requestPlayerRatings, and requestCryptogram.






 














This design encapsulates different types depending on its concern. Proper encapsulation is key for loose-coupling and flexibility. 

In addition, proper naming of properties and methods is paramount for the successful communication of requirements across all team members. 

In the process of coming up with this design, it was crucial to combine the best intuitions present in each of the team's designs. Coming up with a class structure that is clean, concise and properly scope is key for properly capturing and executing requirements. 

## *Summary*

Main objective of coming together as a team for the final design was to get individual as well as collective team feedback which turned out to be quite useful. At the beginning, a review word document was shared amongst the team members in between successive team meetings. This way, each team member was able to perform first draft of the review based on other team member's design. This left each team member and the team collectively in a better position to address the do's and don’ts for the final design and by the time the team got together to discuss the final design each member had a clear idea of what was to go into the final design.

The whole experience of team work highlighted both theoretical and industrial practices of software development process. This approach and the feedback from within the team also helped each team member to review the capabilities of their own individual design. Building the final design was an iterative process with the team observing and mitigating possible design shortcomings along the way.

The team also took a fresh approach by re-visiting the requirements for assignment 5. Although, the final design was a version of one of the team member's design, re-visiting the requirements helped the team address the task at hand in a much better way. Finally, when compiling the team design, members put extra effort to make it precisely while clearly portraying what was required of it without making it too intricate.
