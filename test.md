## Word Scramble Game

## *Individual Designs*

### Design 1

![Isaac Silva's Design](designs/design_Isaac_Silva.png)

The UML design shown above was created by Isaac Silva. One of the main highlights for this design is that it is very clean and very well organized. The design has excellent portrayal of the overall system to be implemented which made it very easy to visualize the overall design of the system. The design avoids extra cluttering by including most of the design requirements within four modules and also incorporates all the functional requirements needed by the system. Class components described in the UML are consistent i.e all components accurately display class specific attributes and functions. Design also uses a combination of getter and setter methods encompassing good programming practice. Interaction between the components are showcased explicitly by providing concise explanation of each connection.

As an entry point to the application, the designer uses a 'User' class by including most of the essential design requirements such as creating a new player, viewing player statistics, maintaining game progress, solved game list, etc. Similarly, the 'Game' class, quite aptly, handles everything pertaining to the word scramble game as well as the statistics. The external web service utility also appropriately addresses the design requirements.

While the design covers everything that is required, it does not include any underlying database, which according to the designer, seems to be unnecessary for the model. Although, the design in less cluttered with minimal modules, however, to make the design easier to implement a few additional modules addressing specific tasks such as dedicated module to statistics, creating a new player, etc would have been more appropriate from implementation point of view. Never the less, the design makes a lot of sense overall and is used as the basis for the final team design. 


### Design 2

The design presented above was created by Mukul Pai. Including a 'Statistics' class to encapsulate the logic of how to get statistics is one the main postives of this design. This design also expresses cardinality quite appropriately between the 'User' and the 'Player' and then between the 'Player' and the 'Scramble' classes. Another highlight of the design is that object oriented approach is clearly defined between the 'Scramble' class and associated classes 'NewScramble', 'ProgressScramble', etc & then between the 'Statistics' class and 'PlayerStatistics' and 'ScrambleStatistics' classes.

Similar to the rest of the team members, the design uses a 'User' class as an entry point to the application handling all the information that is required to create a new player. Along with that, the Scramble class and its associated classes clearly separated, addressing all what was required as part of the design requirements, however, the return data types for few of the methods were not that explicit, specifically the statistics object returned by few methods do not mentioned the returned data types.

The design having more detailed UML design can be very apt in some cases, however, a more simpler design could have been more appropriate as some of the additional classes could have been engulfed into the parent classes such as the 'Loggedin' feature and scramble (in-progress, completed). Another feaure not present in the diagram was an underlying database to handle player, scramble and statistical information.


### Design 3

This design was generated by Saad Khan. From the user point of view, this application design excellently covers all the different components that are to be involved in the application with accurate interactions and flow. Good design principles were followed to showcase attributes of each component along with their functionalities. This design also had similarities with another team member's design in terms of the appraoch taken to include statistics class (playerStatistics, scrambleStatistics) and also having multiple instances of the word scramble.

In comparison to rest of the individual member design, the application design begins a user class, where the user has a choice of either choosing to login if his/her user profile is already in the system otherwise just choose to enter as new player in order to land onto a new player profile creation page/activity. This way the design for the UI point of view seems less cluttered, however, a more simpler approch could have been to encompass it as an instance of the player class rather keeping it as a separate class. 

The design also includes an underlying database (providing connectivity between the external web service (EWS) and rest of the modules), which during team discussion was considered a feature that could have been excluded from the UML and this way the EWS, a centralized utility, could have been connected in a way to be accessed by all other components in the system. Overall nice job but there seem to be quite a few class and the design coudl have been simplified in certain cases such as 'createWordScramble' class could have been an instance of the 'wordScramble' class while 'solveWordScramble' class could aslo have been described a method for the 'wordScramble' class.



## *Team Design*

![Team Design](designs/design_team.png)

As a collective team effort, we setup multiple calls to re-visit various requirements of the design and reviewed pros and cons for each individual member's design. The disscussions were thorough which led to the final UML deisgn as shown above, which is an enhanced/updated version of the individual UML created by one of the team members, Isaac Silva (Design 1). The team was in unanimous agreement that the application's entry point should be the 'User' class also evident in all the individual UML designs as well as the final design. It was decided that the 'User' class will give three options to the user to (1) create a new user profile by accepting user credentials such as first name, last name, email, username, etc, (2) login if the profile is already in the system by askig for a unique username and an option to (3) logout from the application when required. This approach led to an agreement amongst team members on how to distinguish between new and existing players right when the application is launched.

Although, the 'User' class was present in all 3 individual designs, it had different purpose for each design. While, for Mukul's (Design 2) and Saad's (Design 3) design, the 'User' class was never directly fetching player statistics, in Isaac's individual design (Design 1) the 'User' class was providing methods to fetch player statistics, game progress, games created, etc. A lot of thought process went into keeping the 'User' class as clean/less cluttered as possible. the idea of incorporating a separate class for player statistics helped fine tune the 'User' class to only include necessary methods as described above ('createNewPlayer', 'login', 'logout'). The details of separate classes for statistics is discussed in the following paragraphs.

It was also agreed upon amongst the members that once the user is logged in as an existing player, he/she will have four options to choose from. (1) to create a word scramble, realized by the 'Game' class which will serve as a blueprint for word scramble creations. For the case (2) where a player has to choose and solve word scrambles, this is realized by 'PlayEvent' association class providing actual game instance for a user. For the other 2 options, there was a lot of discussion on how to realize the viewing statistics part (both player and scramble), once the player has logged in. Two members, Mukul (Design 2) and Saad (Design 3), had explicitly used separate scramble and player statistic classes in their individual designs which was not the case in Isaac's design (Design 1), so as a result of team discussions it was collectively agreed upon that in order to better encapsulate the functionality required by the scramble statistics and player statistics components, addition of 2 utility classes will be helpful. For this reason, 'ScrambleStatistics' and 'PlayerStatistics' utility classes are added to Isaac's design which will be responsible for retrieving all the statistics around scrambles and players. In assoication with these utility classes (once the player is logged in) for the case (3) where a player wants to be able to view statistics on their created and solved word scrambles, will be addressed by addition of a class 'ScrambleStatistic' associated with each 'Game' instance. For the case (4) where a player may view his/her own statistics, a similar class 'PlayerStatistic' is added which is associated with each 'Player' instance.

Realization of the case where the user is a new player was straight forward and it was communally decided within the team (also present in all 3 individual designs) that the user, while creating a new player profile, will pass on inputs as new user credentials onto the 'addUser' method in the external web service utility (EWS) which will then return a unique user ID for that new player which will register that player with the system. In contrast to this, for the scenario where player has an option to create a new word scramble, all 3 designs had taken different approaches, however, for the final design, this requirement was realized based primarily on Isaac's individual design by using only the 'createNewGame', 'refreshCrumbledPhrase' and 'saveGame' methods inside the 'Game' class while excluding 'getGameList', 'updateSolvedTimes' and 'getScrambleStatistics' methods which were also present in his original individual design. Similarly, most of the getter and setter methods such as 'getinProgressGameList', 'getSolvedGameList', 'setNumberOfSolvedGames' etc, which were part of the 'User' class in Isaac's individual design were also excluded from the 'User' class in the final design. All of the above mentioned methods/functionalities, in the final design, reside under inside the 'ScrambleStatistic' and the 'PlayerStatistic' classes.

Further discussion between the team members took place on how to represent statistics requirements more efficiently. Instead of creating only 2 classes, one for addressing scramble statistics (requirement 11 - assignment 5) and another one for addressing player statistics (requirement 12 - assignment 5), the idea of keeping separate utility classes (<<utility>> - ScrambleStatistics, <<utility>> - PlayerStatistics) and 'Game' & 'User' associated classes ('ScrambleStatistic', 'PlayerStatistic') was specifically incorporated into the final design for proper encapsulation by providing loose-coupling and flexibility. While almost all of the requirements in point 11 and 12 were addressed in the associated classes'PlayerStatistic' and 'ScrambleStatistic', only methods such as <<utility>> - ScrambleStatistics: ('getScrambleStatistics', 'getGameList') and <<utility>> - PlayerStatistics: ('getPlayerStatistics') were kept in the respective utility classes in order to utilize the EWS to extract the desired statistics. These methods were added to their respective statistics classes in order to wrap the calls to the methods in the ExternalWebService utility class and perform the desired filtering and calculations. 

It was agreed upon within the team that coming up with a class structure that is clean, concise and properly scoped is the key for properly capturing and executing requirements. Structuring the final design this way made it less cluttered and was a combination of best intuitions present in each of the individual team member's design.


## *Summary*

Main objective of coming together as a team for the final design was to get individual as well as collective team feedback which turned out to be quite useful. At the beginning, a review word document was shared amongst the team members in between successive team meetings. This way, each team member was able to perform first draft of the review based on other team member's design. This left each team member and the team collectively in a better position to address the do's and don’ts for the final design and by the time the team got together to discuss the final design each member had a clear idea of what was to go into the final design.

The whole experience of team work highlighted both theoretical and industrial practices of software development process. This approach and the feedback from within the team also helped each team member to review the capabilities of their own individual design. Building the final design was an iterative process with the team observing and mitigating possible design shortcomings along the way.

The team also took a fresh approach by re-visiting the requirements for assignment 5. Although, the final design was a version of one of the team member's design, re-visiting the requirements helped the team address the task at hand in a much better way. Finally, when compiling the team design, members put extra effort to make it precisely while clearly portraying what was required of it without making it too intricate.
