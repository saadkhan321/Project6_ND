The following list contains supplementary, non-functional requirements that are believed to be important enough to document but that do not fit into any of the other documentation. These requirements include considerations such as reliability, maintainability, and security.

* The UI should be readable, responsive, and easy to navigate
* The app should be maintainable through patching
* The user manual should be clear, concise, and understandable by the target users of the app
* Efforts taken to secure user data should be appropriate for the sensitivity of that data
